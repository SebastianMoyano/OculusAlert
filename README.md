 # WARNING I DID THE CODE IN HALF AN HOUR TO 1 HOUR, SO IT MOST THAN CERTAIN HAS MANY FLAWS, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

  IVE TESTED AND IT WORKS OK FOR ME ATLEAST.
 
 This is a script that i made very fast, so you can check for any update on oculus quest.
 i made a .exe file so its easier to make it work if  you dont want to use the script.
 requeriments:
 
 1.- OculusAlert.exe and credential.txt must be in same dir (same goes for .py if your going to use it)
 
 2.- fill the credential.txt with email and password
 
 3.- allow unsafe apps for gmail https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
 
 4.- right click on OculusAlert.exe and open it
 
 with this it should be ready,it will check each minute the oculus page.
 
 Note: Each time your computer turns off you have to execute again.
 I've test it in windows 10 pro
 
sorry for the sloppy description, i will complete it in the next few days
