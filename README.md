# OculusAlert
 Python script to check on oculus quest
 
 This is a script that i made very fast, so you can check for any update on oculus quest.
 i made a .exe file so its easier to make it work if  you dont want to use the script.
 requeriments:
 1.- OculusAlert.exe and credential.txt must be in same dir (same goes for .py if your going to use it)
 2.- allow unsafe apps for gmail https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
 3.- right click on OculusAlert.exe and open it
 with this it should be ready, each time your computer turns off you have to execute again.
 
sorry for the sloppy description, i will complete it in the next few days
